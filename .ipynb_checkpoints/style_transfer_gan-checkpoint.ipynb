    "Artists like Claude Monet are recognized for the unique styles of their works, such as the unique colour scheme and brush strokes. These are hard to be imitated by normal people, and even for professional painters, it will not be easy to produce a painting whose style is Monet-esque. However, thanks to the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their many variations, Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers can build and train deep learning models to bring an artist's peculiar style to your photos. \n",

A vanilla GAN has two parts, a Generator network which we denote by $\\boldsymbol G$ and a Discriminator network which we denote by $\\boldsymbol D$. $\\boldsymbol G$ tries to fool $\\boldsymbol D$ through continuously improving its own ability to produce images that are fake but close to the real images. $\\boldsymbol D$ is responsible for distinguishing the fake images from the real images and keeps on improving the correctness of its predictions (classifications). Here is a visualization of a vanilla GAN architecture from [this publication](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Architecture-of-vanilla-GAN_fig1_347477054?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkGuidedProjectsIBMGPXX0KSEEN39299759-2022-01-01):\n",

    "First of all, unlike other GAN models for image-to-image translation, CycleGANs **do not require paired training data**. For example, if we are interested in translating photographs of winter landscapes to summer landscapes, we do not require each winter landscape to have its corresponding summer view exist in the dataset. This allows the development of image translation models for tasks where paired training datasets are not available.\n",

    "With one $\\boldsymbol G$ that learns a mapping between two domains of images $X$ and $Y$ such that the output $\\hat y = \\boldsymbol G(x)$ is indistinguishable from $y \\in Y$ by $\\boldsymbol D$ trained to classify $\\hat y$ apart from $y$, we simply can not guarantee that $x$ and $y$ are paired up in a meaningful way. For instance, it probably won't make sense to transfer the style of a Fuji mountain photo in the same way we transfer the style of a cat photo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, to ensure that the mapping $\\boldsymbol G: X \\rightarrow Y$ is constrained and meaningful, we introduce a second, inverse mapping $\\boldsymbol F: Y \\rightarrow X$ to ensure that $F(G(x)) \\approx x$ and $G(F(y)) \\approx y$, which means **an image translation cycle should be able to bring an image back to the original image**.\n",
